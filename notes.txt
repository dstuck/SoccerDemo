Just had the realization that what you really care about controlling in soccer 
is the movement of the ball not the player. That means when you have the ball,
saying to go the opposite way should direct the player to go even further 
forward to kick you backwards

What if all controls were for the ball and were just delegated to players who
have more complex controls that can can be puppeted by the ball?


Setting one unit per meter requires scaling sprites. i.e. man sprite is 76 pixels high, so need to set 42 pix/unit so that he is 1.8 units tall or ~6 ft
10 miles per hour (6 minute mile) is 4.47 m/s
